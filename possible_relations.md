# Data
1. products: contains the product identifier, the dimensions, the weight, category, name and description, the number of pictures
2. customers: id,

# Relations:

## Products: 
* products with more pictures are more popular (consider aggregating the product categories) current no 
* products with longer (supposedly more engaging) description are more popular (maybe consider the aggregation of product categories) (investigating)
* weight might be somehow related to shipping: heavier weights take longer to ship (grouped together maybe)

## Customer
* What about the mean and variance of spending / number of products purchased by customers in the 2 major cities (Sao Paulo and Rio De janeiro) ? can any meaningful insights be derived from that ?
* can we find different means for different regions in general: states / or simply groups created from the geo coordinates? (might require some geospatial processing)

## Payment
* Are customers inclined to spend more with a more payments ?
## Sellers
* Are sellers in certain regions making more money that other regions ?
*
