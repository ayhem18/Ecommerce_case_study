Please follow the instructions below to have the code run locally

1. clone our public repository (with the source code) with following command
```git clone https://github.com/ayhem18/Ecommerce_case_study```

2. create / activate a local python environment, (we would not recommend using the global environment since we will be installing several packages)

3. install the packages needed to run the code with the following command: 
```python -m pip install requirements.txt```

4. run the src/data_preparation.py file to download the data locally with the following command: 
* Linux: 
```python src/data_preparation.py```
* Windowns: 
```python src\data_preparation.py```

at this point the data should be downloaded locally in a 'data' folder.

5. run the 'main.ipynb' file and enjoy the insights we extracted from the "OList Ecommerce dataset"
